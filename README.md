# JSON-Reader
Takes in a json file and puts its contents in a nicely formatted text file.
I specifically made it to be able to my Instagram account's data, you can request it too from them if you own an account.

NOTE There are 3 special methods that get executed if you give it files called "messages.json", "searches.json" or "likes.json".
They provide better readabilty for those files. They only work on the files you can request from Instagram.
