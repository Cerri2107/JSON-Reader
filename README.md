# JSON-Reader
Takes in a json file and puts its contents in a nicely formatted text file. I specifically made it to be able to read my Instagram account's data, you too can get it from them if you own an account. The default input directory is "inputdata/" but you can change it to whatever you want. Same goes for output.

NOTE There are 3 special methods that get executed if you give it files called "messages.json", "searches.json" or "likes.json".
They provide better readabilty for those files. They only work on the files you can request from Instagram.
